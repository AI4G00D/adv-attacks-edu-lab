# 🔐 adv-attacks-edu-lab

**Educational Lab for Adversarial Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Model (LLM) Attacks**  
*— with strong emphasis on AI safety, ethical demonstration, and responsible use.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is a curated educational playground showcasing adversarial attacks in both traditional ML and LLM systems. It aims to help students, security researchers, and AI developers understand how models can be manipulated—and how to defend against such threats.

> ⚠️ All experiments and demos are conducted in isolated environments and are intended strictly for **educational purposes**.

🛡️ Ethical Disclaimer

This repository is strictly for educational and awareness purposes.
All demonstrations are designed in controlled conditions to explain vulnerabilities—not to exploit them.

🔒 Do NOT use these techniques on:

    Live systems

    Commercial APIs

    Unconsented models

    Production deployments

⚠️ Misuse of adversarial techniques may result in violations of law, academic codes, or corporate policy.
